# Sample_Page

Was asked to create a single web page similar to the image provided. They didn't provide images or fonts,
so I had to make due what was given to me. 

was given the task:
* Add Javascript code to make the secondary navigation to be sticky. As you scroll down the page, it should remain on top of the screen.
* Add a dropdown menu
* When user clicks on "MORE V", it should reveal the remaining text.
